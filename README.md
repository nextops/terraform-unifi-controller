# terraform-unifi-controller
Manage linuxserver-unifi-controller containers with Terraform

Initially with Digital Ocean

## Purpose

- Continuous deployment of new image versions
- (later maybe) separation of persistent storage from ephemeral containers

## Caveats

- Digital Ocean Apps do not support a VPC nor ACLs
